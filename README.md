<h1 id="-philo">üçù Philosphers</h1>
<p>Philosophers is a C project coded during my studies at school 42.<br>
It takes up the problem of the philosophers' dinner, which allows us to discover threads as well as mutexes.<br><br>
The problem is simple:<br>
N philosophers meet around a table to eat spaghetti. They can eat, think or sleep, but not at the same time. To eat, they must have two forks, knowing that there are as many forks as there are philosophers. After eating, they have to sleep. The goal is to keep them alive as long as possible, because after x amount of time without eating, philosophers die. When a philosopher dies, the program stops.<br>
For more information on this problem or on the constraints imposed, I invite you to read the topic provided in the repo.</p>
